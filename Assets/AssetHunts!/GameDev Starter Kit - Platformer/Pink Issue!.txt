Are you seeing pink materials after importing this Asset Pack?

🟥Issue:
This usually happens due to a conflict caused by using a different Render Pipeline.

🟩Fix:
01. Go to the Convert Render Pipeline folder inside the asset pack.
02. Choose the correct .unitypackage file based on your current Render Pipeline:
• [URP] – For Universal Render Pipeline
• [HDRP] – For High Definition Render Pipeline
